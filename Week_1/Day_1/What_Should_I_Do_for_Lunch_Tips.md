### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  if (hungry === false) {
    console.log("Wait.");
  } else if (hungry === true) {
    if (availableTime < 20) {
      console.log("Pick something up and eat in back in the Lab or in the kitchen, where you can get to know your fellow classmates");
    }
    if (availableTime >= 20 && availableTime <= 30) {
      console.log("You deserve a break and could try a place in Gastown.");
    } else {
      console.log("You should probably reconsider.");
    }
  }
};
```
